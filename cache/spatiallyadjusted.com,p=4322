<p>Look, I’m a realist when it comes to software and philosophy.  Use what gets your work done faster, more efficiently and without killing the penguins down in Antarctica.  I can’t even remember if open source software is “free as in beer” or “free as in I’m a cheap bastard”.  But what I do know is that if you aren’t familiar with all the tools available to you, there is a chance you maybe be doing things inefficiently and probably incorrectly.</p>
<p>That’s why I think this year, a great opportunity for everyone in North America <a class="simple-footnote" href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/feed/#note-4322-1" id="return-note-4322-1" title="I’ve got nothing but love for our brothers and sisters in Canada, Mexico and Central America"><sup>1</sup></a> to make time to visit Denver for <a href="http://2011.foss4g.org/">FOSS4G 2011</a> next month.  Since FOSS4G was last in our neck of the woods in 2007, the geospatial world has changed a ton.  So many new projects are available and more mature than ever before.  The choice that we all have today is greater than ever before and FOSS4G 2011 will give us all a chance to see what’s new and how we can use these projects in our workflows. 3 days in Denver will give you the information you’ll need to succeed in this space as it rapidly changes. Siting back and letting the world move forward without you is a recipe for obsolescence.</p>
<p>A quick look at <a href="http://2011.foss4g.org/program/session-schedule">the schedule</a> shows that there are tons of great sessions to be involved with and for those who haven’t been exposed to open source projects before, there is a great <a href="http://2011.foss4g.org/content/introduction-geospatial-open-source">Introduction to Geospatial Open Source</a> that will help you get a better handle on your options.  I’ll be there all week and so will most of the big geo-personalitites in our space.  They all realize that this is an opportunity that only comes around once ever 5 years (yes it’s been that long since we’ve had one in North America) and you can’t afford to miss out.</p>
<p>FOSS4G 2011 is a “super” choice!</p>
